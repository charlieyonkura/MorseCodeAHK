# MorseCodeAHK

Hello, this is a tool intended for www.morsecode.me, to automate morse code transmissions.

Once you open the program, you will enter your message to be transmitted, then press OK.

You may then press CTRL + Q while focused on the website (or wherever else) to transmit the message.

CTRL + X exits the program at any time.

This was one of my first meaningful projects in programming. The task was to automate sending messages on the morse code chatroom www.morsecode.me. This project is written in AutoHotKey. The choice of programming language was due to its easy compatibility with Windows processes and keypresses. This script features nested for loops, an if-else ladder, string manipulation, and functions. Revisiting this project, I would probably choose to use Python with a library, and a different input method.
